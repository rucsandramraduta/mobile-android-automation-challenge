		1. Why did you choose the framework you used? 
		I used Espresso because it’s the same framework as you guys are using. I have never used it before so I was curious to see how difficult it is to set up the test environment.  
		

		2. What were the advantages and disadvantages of your choice?
		An advantage for using Espresso is the speed and reliability that the tests have. 

		Another advantage would be the fact that setting up the environment was super fast and straight forward. I was surprised that I was able to run the tests so easily with minimum setup.

		The first drawback that i have encountered, even before starting to write tests is the fact that it covers only Android. This means that a completely different solution needs to be developed for iOS. 

		The second "drawback" is that espresso works best with Java and Kotlin which makes it perfect for Android oriented developers/testers so it narrows down the technology stack. 

		
		3. What was the most complicated part? 
		The  most complicated part of my challenge was to work with recyclerview container. I have  been struggling a bit to find the best way to test items inside the returned list. 


		4. Which good coding practices did you follow when writing your tests? 
		-  I have commented the tests i have written so that others can easily understand what the test is about
		- I've indented my code for easy readability
		- I've broken the lines in order not to have long lines of code exceeding the length of the screen
		- I have used existing libraries instead of creating custom methods (when possible)

		 
		5. How do you make sure your code is maintainable by other team members?  
		I would say that by applying the above  mentioned measures, my code becomes maintainable and easy to understand by other team members. Also by agreeing on common guidelines inside the team and following them, creates consistency when writing/maintaining future code.
